Goofys is a Filey-System interface to [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

# Overview

Goofys allows you to mount an S3 bucket as a filey system.

It's a Filey System instead of a File System because goofys strives
for performance first and POSIX second. Particularly things that are
difficult to support on S3 or would translate into more than one
round-trip would either fail (random writes) or faked (no per-file
permission). Goofys does not have a on disk data cache, and
consistency model is close-to-open.

# Usage

Pre-built binaries are available [here](https://github.com/kahing/goofys/releases/).

```ShellSession
$ go get github.com/kahing/goofys
$ go install github.com/kahing/goofys
$ cat > ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKID1234567890
aws_secret_access_key = MY-SECRET-KEY
$ $GOPATH/bin/goofys <bucket> <mountpoint>
```

Users can also configure credentials via the
[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
or the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` environment variables.

# Benchmark

Using `--stat-cache-ttl 0 --type-cache-ttl 0` for goofys
`-ostat_cache_expire=1` for s3fs to simulate cold runs. Detail for the
benchmark can be found in
[bench.sh](https://github.com/kahing/goofys/blob/master/bench.sh). [Raw data](https://github.com/kahing/goofys/blob/master/bench.data)
is available as well. Test was run on an EC2 c4.xlarge in us-west-2a
connecting to a bucket in us-west-2.

# Current Status

List of not yet implemented fuse operations:
  * in terms of syscalls
    * `readlink`
    * `chmod`/`utimes`/`ftruncate`
  * in terms of fuse functions
    * `ReadSymlink`
    * `SetInodeAttributes`

List of non-POSIX behaviors/limitations:
  * only sequential writes supported
  * does not support appending to a file yet
  * file mode is always 0644 for regular files and 0700 for directories
  * directories link count is always 2
  * file owner is always the user running goofys
  * `ctime`, `atime` is always the same as `mtime`
  * cannot rename non-empty directories
  * `unlink` returns success even if file is not present
  * can only create files up to 50GB
