# Overview

Goofys allows you to mount an S3 bucket as a filey system.

It's a Filey System instead of a File System because goofys strives
for performance first and POSIX second. Particularly things that are
difficult to support on S3 or would translate into more than one
round-trip would either fail (random writes) or faked (no per-file
permission). Goofys does not have an on disk data cache (checkout
[catfs](https://github.com/kahing/catfs)), and consistency model is
close-to-open.

# Installation

* On Linux, install via [pre-built binaries](http://bit.ly/goofys-latest). You may also need to install fuse-utils first.

* On macOS, install via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```ShellSession
$ brew cask install osxfuse
$ brew install goofys
```

* Or build from source with Go 1.9 or later:

```ShellSession
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/work
$ go get github.com/kahing/goofys
$ go install github.com/kahing/goofys
```

# Usage

```ShellSession
$ cat ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKID1234567890
aws_secret_access_key = MY-SECRET-KEY
$ $GOPATH/bin/goofys <bucket> <mountpoint>
$ $GOPATH/bin/goofys <bucket:prefix> <mountpoint> # if you only want to mount objects under a prefix
```

Users can also configure credentials via the
[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
or the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

To mount an S3 bucket on startup, make sure the credential is
configured for `root`, and can add this to `/etc/fstab`:

```
goofys#bucket   /mnt/mountpoint        fuse     _netdev,allow_other,--file-mode=0666    0       0
```

# Benchmark

Using `--stat-cache-ttl 1s --type-cache-ttl 1s` for goofys
`-ostat_cache_expire=1` for s3fs to simulate cold runs. Detail for the
benchmark can be found in
[bench.sh](https://github.com/kahing/goofys/blob/master/bench/bench.sh). [Raw data](https://github.com/kahing/goofys/blob/master/bench/)
is available as well. The test was run on an EC2 m4.16xlarge in us-west-2a
connected to a bucket in us-west-2. Units are seconds.

![Benchmark result](/bench/bench.png?raw=true "Benchmark")

(â€ ) riofs does not wait for HTTP response before returning from `release()`, so the create files benchmarks do not measure the right thing for it

## Benchmark with caching enabled

Enabling `--cache` has little impact on write speed (since `catfs`
implements a write-through cache) but read has a large variance. Time
to first byte is competitive with `s3fs` which suggests layering fuse
filesystems can be a viable approach.

![Cached Benchmark result](/bench/bench-cached.png?raw=true "Cached Benchmark")


<a name="runbenchmark"></a>
To run the benchmark, do:

```ShellSession
$ cat > ~/.passwd-riofs
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKID1234567890
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=MY-SECRET-KEY
$ sudo docker run -e BUCKET=$TESTBUCKET -e CACHE=false --rm --privileged --net=host -v  ~/.passwd-riofs:/root/.passwd-riofs -v /tmp/cache:/tmp/cache kahing/goofys-bench
# result will be written to $TESTBUCKET
```

if `CACHE` is set to `true`, the read benchmarks ('Read 1GB' and 'Time to 1st byte') will be cached read.

# Current Status

goofys has been tested under Linux and macOS.

List of non-POSIX behaviors/limitations:
  * only sequential writes supported
  * does not store file mode/owner/group
    * use `--(dir|file)-mode` or `--(uid|gid)` options
  * does not support symlink or hardlink
  * `ctime`, `atime` is always the same as `mtime`
  * cannot rename non-empty directories
  * `unlink` returns success even if file is not present
  * `fsync` is ignored, files are only flushed on `close`

In addition to the items above, the following are supportable but not yet implemented:
  * creating files larger than 1TB

## Compatibility with non-AWS S3

goofys has been tested with the following non-AWS providers:

* Amplidata
* DreamObjects (Ceph)
* EMC Atmos
* Google Cloud Storage
* OpenStack Swift
* S3Proxy
* Minio (limited)
